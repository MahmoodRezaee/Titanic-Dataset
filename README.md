Survey of Machine Learning Algorithms to Predict Survival of Passengers on the Titanic Dataset:
In this study, we will use machine-learning techniques to predict which passengers survived the Titanic using data from ”Kaggle.” Predictions will be based on factors such as ticket price, age, sex, and class. To compare the various machine-learning techniques, we take several approaches.
By looking at the results of each technique, we can give some insights into the problem. In predicting the survival of each passenger, fare, sex/title, age, passenger class, and price were the most relevant predictors. A machine learning model helps tune a model by ”learning” or ”analyzing” each passenger to provide accurate predictions.
Dataset:
The Titanic dataset used in this project is provided by Kaggle. In this dataset, there are 891 training samples of passengers with their associated survival labels. Each
passenger was given his/her passenger class, name, sex, age, number of siblings/spouses aboard, number of parents/children aboard, ticket number, fare, cabin embarked, and port of embarkation. The test data consisted of 418 samples of the same format.
For several samples, one or more fields were missing (Not a Number, NaN) and marked empty (especially in the latter fields - age, fare, cabin, and port). However, all sample points contained information about the passenger class and gender at least.
